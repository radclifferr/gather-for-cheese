            <p>So quick and easy! Looking for the perfect appetizer to bring to the dinner party or family gathering? Well, look no further we have you covered! </p>
            <p>This dish is warm, sweet, salty, and savory. The whipped feta and blueberry dip can be served cold or warm, however, we prefer to serve it warm with crunchy toasted sourdough bread. A combination of feta, blueberries, balsamic, and basil is always a crowd-pleaser. </p>
            <p>This dip never disappoints. It will surely disappear as quickly as it can be prepared (and trust me that’s fast!). We’ll show you how to prepare this sweet and savory recipe below!</p>

            <p><strong>Rule Of Thumb: Sweet with Stinky</strong></p>
            <p>It may seem strange to combine stinky funky cheeses with sweet flavors but it is truly a match made in heaven. The sweetness from foods such as fruits, honey, or wine can help tone down some of the stronger flavors from the cheese. Having this balanced flavor is what your friends and family will crave (even if they don’t know it yet).</p>
            <p>Since we have gotten the main rule out of the way, below are some suggested cheese, food, and wine pairings your friends and family will love on your next charcuterie board.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Things to eat with blue cheese:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Honey served on toasted baguette</li>
                    <li>Pears</li>
                    <li>Thin cookies (ginger, shortbread, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Things to drink with blue cheese:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Port wines</li>
                    <li>Malbec</li>
                    <li>Chardonnay</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We love trying new flavor combinations. It’s been fun to help our friends and family try new combos and have even turned blue cheese haters into blue cheese lovers. We hope to help you do the same!</p>

            <p>Ever wondered what to add to your cheese board for more flavor? Well, these delicious warm olives are the perfect addition. The saltiness of the olives paired with sweet citrus and flavorful herbs will keep your guests (and their taste buds) happy. And to make these olives even better, they are served warm!</p>
            <p>Don’t be deterred if you have never loved olives in the past. These marinated olives will never disappoint. I wasn’t a big fan of olives until making this recipe and now I can’t get enough of them! With a coating in olive oil and herbs the natural flavor of the olives finally comes out and curbs their saltiness.</p>
